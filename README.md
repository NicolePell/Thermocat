Thermocat
=================

Week 6 project: Build a thermostat web application using javascript with jQuery and Handlebar templates. The thermostat should be able to adjust the temperature in your house with Power Saver Mode enabled by default. Maximum temperature is determined by whether Power Save Mode is on.

Thermocat should also be able to tell us what temperature it is outside, using the OpenWeather.org API, queried with JSON.

Built in Sinatra with HTML5 and CSS. Deployed on Heroku:
